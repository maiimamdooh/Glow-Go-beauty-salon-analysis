# Glow & Go Salon - Dashboard Analysis & Business Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
A comprehensive data analysis of Glow & Go Salon's performance metrics, featuring:
- Interactive dashboard with KPIs
- Marketing channel ROI analysis
- Staff performance benchmarking
- Predictive pricing tools

### 📈 Performance Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Bookings | 2,000 |
| Total Revenue | $1.6M |
| Total Profit | $1.5M |
| Top Service | Haircuts (34.19%) |
| Peak Day | Tuesday ($241K) |

### 🏆 Top Insights
1. **Traditional Marketing Wins**: Flyers outperformed digital ads (418K vs Facebook's 411K)
2. **Staff Excellence**: Taylor generated 37.06% of total revenue
3. **Service Balance**: Haircuts > Massage > Facials (but all within 2% of each other)

## Dashboard Features
-  **KPI Cards**: Visualize monthly sales, profits, and ad costs with comparison to previous months.
-  **Dynamic Filters**: Enable filtering by year and month to allow custom time-based performance analysis.

**Why This Matters for the Salon Owner:**
- ✅ **Track Growth:** The salon can see if sales are increasing or decreasing month-over-month.
- ✅ **Identify Seasonal Trends:** For example, if October 2024 showed a profit peak, they can plan promotions for the same period next year.
- ✅ **Cost Control:** If ad costs rise but sales don’t, they can adjust spending before losses occur.

- ### **Price Adjustment Feature (Discount Impact Prediction)**
The dashboard includes a price adjustment simulation tool, which helps predict how discounts or price changes affect profit.

If the salon considers a 10% discount on facials, the tool can estimate:
- How many more bookings they might get.
- Whether the increased volume compensates for the lower price.
- The net impact on total profit.

**Why This Is Powerful for Decision-Making?**
- ✅ **Avoid Profit Loss:** Instead of guessing, the salon can test discount strategies before applying them.
- ✅ **Optimize Promotions:** If a 15% discount on weekdays brings more customers without hurting profit, they can implement it confidently.
- ✅ **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust prices during peak vs. slow days to maximize revenue.

## Final Business Recommendations
- Use the Monthly Sales KPI to spot trends and prepare for high/low seasons.
- Optimize Ad Spend by focusing on flyers while testing Facebook/Instagram tweaks.
- Simulate Discounts Before Launching to ensure promotions boost sales without killing profits.
- Adjust Prices Strategically—maybe increase prices on Tuesdays (high demand) and offer discounts on Thursdays (low demand).
